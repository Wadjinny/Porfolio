During my missions, I had the opportunity to create an impressive dashboard that presented the performance indicators of the API. By utilizing the powerful tool of GCP, I was able to identify customer issues with ease. In addition, I conducted a comparison of algorithm predictions to reference results, analyzing key indicators such as Pearson's ICC correlation and Bland-Altman charts. The implementation of my skills in Python, Pandas, Scipy/Stats, Google Cloud, Streamlit, and JSON manipulation made these missions a remarkable experience.
